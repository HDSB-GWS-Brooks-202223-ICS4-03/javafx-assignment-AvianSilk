# ICS4U Wordle Program - Rubric

[TOC]

## Mini Reflection

Name: Venkata Adapala

I think my program is a level 4 because it is not only a decent, functional game that is easy to understand, but also a game that goes beyond the level 3 game requirements

The extra features I included in my program are:
- A clear, good-looking, sensible appearance including dark mode, appropriate colors, etc.
- A way to reset the game and play again, ensuring that one does not have to re-build the code in order to have another go at it.
- Animations for when the user wins, guesses an invalid word, resets the game, etc.
